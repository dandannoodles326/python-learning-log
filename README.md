# Hangman Game 🎯

This is a simple command-line Hangman game I built as part of the **100 Days of Code: Python** course by Dr. Angela Yu.

It selects a random word from a list, and you try to guess it one letter at a time before running out of lives. The game includes ASCII art and feedback for each guess.
